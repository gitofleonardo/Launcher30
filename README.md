# Updates

Any feature or bugfix updates will depend on my plans. Maybe you could do it yourself.

Btw, there's no AOSP-like roms for my Mi-13 device, so I will probably not spend too much time on this project right now.

# Notice

Tested on `PixelExperience`, AndroidT only, it's not guaranteed to work on every rom. Some AOSP-like roms may work, as long as they haven't changed too much of AOSP codes.

For those highly-customized roms like MIUI, I am quite sure it's not working at all, and there's no need to use this module on those roms since they've already provided lots of features.
